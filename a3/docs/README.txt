Compilation
************
To compile the file, you type make into the terminal. There is the option of naming the root folder by having it
as the first command line arguement. To name the root folder and add a file, type the name of the folder first, then
the second command line arguement as the name of the created file.

Running the program(s)
***********************



*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
This program doesn't modify real files and paths, rather it simply simulates file management. I was not aware 
that this program should modify real files as the wording of the assignment was not too clear. However, the
program performs fine when using dummy files, folders and paths. All the functions that are required should be
in working condition.
